# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-18

### Changed - BREAKING CHANGES ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Repository structure reorganized**: All shell scripts moved to `scripts/` directory
- **Installation URL changed**: Update to new path `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bishnubista/cc-statusline/main/scripts/install.sh`
- **Uninstall URL changed**: Update to new path `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bishnubista/cc-statusline/main/scripts/uninstall.sh`

### Added
- Added "Repository Structure" section to README showing new organization
- Improved documentation with clearer installation paths

### Migration Guide
If you installed v1.0.x, the statusline will continue to work (it's already installed in `~/.claude/statusline.sh`).

For new installations or reinstalls, use the new URL:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bishnubista/cc-statusline/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

### Why This Change?
Better project organization with scripts separated into their own directory, making the repository root cleaner with only documentation files (README, CHANGELOG) and configuration examples.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-18

### Removed
- **Token tracking feature**: Removed weekly and session token tracking to simplify the statusline
- **Weekly usage log files**: No longer creates `~/.claude/weekly_usage.json` or `~/.claude/weekly_usage_log.jsonl`
- **`view_weekly_logs.sh` script**: Removed as token tracking is no longer supported

### Changed
- Simplified statusline output to focus on context awareness only (model, directory, branch, output style)
- Updated INSTALLATION.md to reflect simplified feature set
- Reduced dependencies on transcript file parsing

### Why This Change?
This release fully embraces the "Simple Statusline" philosophy by removing metric tracking in favor of pure context awareness. The statusline now displays only what you need to stay oriented (what model, which directory, which branch, what output style) without writing any files or tracking usage.
