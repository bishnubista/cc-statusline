# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-18

### Removed
- **Token tracking feature**: Removed weekly and session token tracking to simplify the statusline
- **Weekly usage log files**: No longer creates `~/.claude/weekly_usage.json` or `~/.claude/weekly_usage_log.jsonl`
- **`view_weekly_logs.sh` script**: Removed as token tracking is no longer supported

### Changed
- Simplified statusline output to focus on context awareness only (model, directory, branch, output style)
- Updated INSTALLATION.md to reflect simplified feature set
- Reduced dependencies on transcript file parsing

### Why This Change?
This release fully embraces the "Simple Statusline" philosophy by removing metric tracking in favor of pure context awareness. The statusline now displays only what you need to stay oriented (what model, which directory, which branch, what output style) without writing any files or tracking usage.
